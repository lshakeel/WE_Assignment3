We had create a php interpretor which also had different users. 
I created the database using migrations and filled it using seedings.
Then the views were created using .blade.php files.
Every thing is being done in the controllers, no services were used.

how to use the application:
create a database named assign
perform migration and seeding
type localhost/laravel/public/assign.php click on login
there are 3 users:
	username		password
	user1@assign.com	pass1
	user2@assign.com	pass2
	user3@assign.com	pass3

user1 and user2 are coders while user3 is the viewer/moderator. you can create more users by clicking on register.
After you have logged in, you can either view your previous code or create code which will run when you submit it.
